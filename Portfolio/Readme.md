My Portfolio 

This is my first project, a personal portfolio website built using only HTML. It highlights my experience, education, projects, and has a dedicated "Contact Me" page. I created this site to introduce myself as a web developer, showcasing my journey, education, and the projects I've worked on. I learned HTML through YouTube tutorials and applied that knowledge here Open index.html in any web browser to view the site. Thank you for checking out my work! Iâ€™m excited to continue growing and improving as a web developer. Stay tuned for more! ðŸ˜Š
