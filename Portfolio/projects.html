            <i>Nov 2020 - May 2021</i>

            Disposal of waste materials including waste plastic bags has become a serious problem and waste plastics are burnt for
            apparent disposal which cause environmental pollution. The plastic wastes can be used in road construction and the field
            tests withstood the stress and proved that plastic wastes used after proper processing as an additive would enhance the
            life of the roads and also solve environmental problems. Plastic use in road construction is not new.
