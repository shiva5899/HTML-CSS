Welcome to my Web Development Projects repository! This repository contains various projects I've built as I explore and enhance my skills in full-stack web development. Here, you'll find projects created using a range of technologies from the front-end to the back-end.

Each project in this repository will utilize some (or all) of the following technologies -
HTML: Structuring web pages
CSS: Styling and layout design
JavaScript: Interactivity and logic on the client-side
React: Building dynamic, component-based front-end applications
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime
Express: Web application framework for building APIs
MongoDB: NoSQL database for managing data
MySQL: Relational database for structured data storage

Projects - 
Front-End Projects: Interactive and responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
Back-End Projects: RESTful APIs and server-side applications built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL.
Full-Stack Projects: Complete web applications that integrate both the front-end and back-end technologies.

Each project will have its own folder with a detailed README file explaining its purpose, features, and instructions for running it.
As I continue learning and growing as a developer, I will keep adding more complex and exciting projects to this repository. Stay tuned!
If you have any questions or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me!
